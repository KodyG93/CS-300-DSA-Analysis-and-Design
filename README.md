# CS-300-DSA-Data-and-Algorithms

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

To create a program that was efficient and sorted information in the fastest way. This program helps ABC university to recommend a schedule for its students for their CIS program. It reads an input csv file separated by commas and links each item to another in a Binary Search Tree (BST) for fast searching purposes. 


How did you approach the problem? 

I wanted to make sure that my program was written in an efficient way with proper notation for the files. I also wanted to make sure that I understood the three data structures we were given, and which would be the best for the project. Due to its simplicity, I went for the fastest load and search features since those are the most important in this project. 


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I used ideas from fellow classmates though our discussion boards and Stack Overflow when I was coding. I had a link error that was very off the wall. I used a suggestion for code improvement from Stack Overflow to overcome this problem. 


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I previously just made the program without much time considering other aspects. Now I think about the speed, efficiency, and memory use of the program I make. Taking time to verify that my code is actually good. 


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made sure that attention was given to proper naming conventions, inline notations, and encapsulation. Doing this made my code more maintainable, readable (understandable), and I can adapt it to handle other task/data as needed.
